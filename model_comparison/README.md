# Scripts for model comparison

### Contents
- ```model_comparison_analysis.ipynb``` – Jupyter notebook to perform and visualise model comparison analysis
- ```compare_models_BMS.m``` – Matlab script that uses BMS toolbox to generate files that are used for the Bayesian Model Selection procedure
- ```compare_models_VBA.m``` – Matlab script that uses VBA toolbox to generate files that are used for the Bayesian Model Selection procedure

## How to run

1. Before running any script make sure you fitted all the models to the behavioural data (see ```model_fitting``` directory)

2. Run both ```compare_models_BMS.m``` and ```compare_models_BMS.m``` using MATLAB R2022b. These scripts will generate files that are necesaary for the Bayesian Model Selection procedure

3. Run the ```model_comparison_analysis.ipynb``` Jupyter notebook to perform and visualise model comparison analysis
