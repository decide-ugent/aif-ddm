# Scripts for model recovery analysis

### Contents
- **main_script.py** – entry point for running the analysis  
- **helper_functions.py** – utility functions  
- **example_notebook.ipynb** – walkthrough with explanations  

## How to run
1. Navigate to this folder in the root directory:
   ```bash
   cd parameter_recovery
   ```
2. Run the Jupyter notebook ```synthetic_data_generator.ypnb``` to generate a simulated dataset for each of the models you are testing. Note that you must change the appropriate variables every time you run it. Each run will generate a folder with the simulated data.
