# aif-ddm
This repository contains code to reproduce the results presented in the paper [Cognitive Effort in the Two-Step Task: An Active Inference Drift-Diffusion Model Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04435), accepted at [IWAI2025](https://iwaiworkshop.github.io/).
This code is a modified version of the code authored by Dr. Sam Gijsen for the paper [Active inference in the two-step task](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-21766-4). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/SamGijsen/AI2step). 


### TL;DR

- Fit models to data

- Compare models based on AIC and BIC scores

- Perform model and parameter recovery analysis

- Analyse and visualise results

### Setup

1. **Create the environment**  

    Before running any code, set up the conda environment using the provided environment file:

    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate hssm_env
    ```
2. **Prepare the dataset**
  
    This repository does not include datasets.

    To use your own dataset, update the relevant file paths accordingly.

    To reproduce the results from the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04435), download the 'magic carpet' dataset provided by Dr. Feher da Silva from this [repository](https://github.com/carolfs/muddled_models/tree/master/results/magic_carpet).

    Place the dataset in a subdirectory named:

    ```text
    two_step_task_datasets/magic_carpet_2020_dataset/
    ```

3. **Directory structure**
    Ensure the dataset folder is located alongside this repository, such that the structure looks like:
    ```text
    .
    ├─ two_step_task_datasets/   
    │   └─ magic_carpet_2020_dataset/
    ├─ aif-ddm/

    ```
